Data:

## Final

##### TURN IN:
- Report (750 pages) [intro, body, conclusion]
- Presentation






## Proposal- Returnables
- [X] code to read data; 
- [ ] descriptions of the variables
- [ ] statistical methods
- [ ] computational steps you will use

### Computation
1. Data Collection- pull Data from Kaggle (wget)
2. Data Cleaning- Convert all Parquet files to CSV (Create some metrics for data conversion to ensure that no data is lost)
3. _Potentially some Feature Engineering_
4. Questions- begin to create code to address questions
* Pick one question for proposal

### Potential Project Focus/Questions:

- Focus on Lyft vs. Uber
    - Which has the higher prices/more likely to surge price?
    - Which finds driver faster/arrives faster?
    - Focus on drivers:
        - Which app pays drivers more?
        - Are Uber or Lyft drivers more likely to get a tip?
- Focus on Supply/Demand
    - When are prices surging and why?
	-any particular regions?
    - Where in NYC are Ubers/Lyfts being called most frequently?
    - Are there any areas that drivers avoid/cancel more frequently?
    - How long (distance and time) are most trips?
- Focus on Driver Compensation
    - How many rides does the average driver do in a day?
    - How much are they making?
    - Do drivers that drive more often get more tips?
- Ride Identification
    - Which license plates are the most frequent drivers?
    - What time in the day do high frequency cars drive?
    - When do low frequency cars drive in the day?
