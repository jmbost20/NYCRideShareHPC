## Final

##### Finish By: May 1st

##### TURN IN:
- Code
- Report (750 pages) [intro, body, conclusion]
- Presentation (~4 Minutes)
- Peer Review

### Work Split
- Data Download
- Converting parquet to CSV
- Questions
	-What values produce the most profit for the driver?
	1. Does a particular company/app have better payed drivers?
	2. Is any particular time of year better than another?
	3. Does length of trip actually have an affect on profit?
	4. Does the time of year affect profit?




## Proposal- Returnables
- [X] code to read data; 
- [X] descriptions of the variables
- [X] statistical methods
- [X] computational steps you will use

### Computation
- Every member tackles one question
- __for now__ use the dummy csv in Rmd to tackle your questions and any notes about data cleaning
- Then we'll all work together on parallizing

1. Data Collection- pull Data from Kaggle (wget)
2. Data Cleaning- Convert all Parquet files to CSV (Create some metrics for data conversion to ensure that no data is lost)
3. _Potentially some Feature Engineering_
4. Questions- begin to create code to address questions
* Pick one question for proposal

### Potential Project Focus/Questions:

- Focus on Lyft vs. Uber
    - Which has the higher prices/more likely to surge price?
    - Which finds driver faster/arrives faster?
    - Focus on drivers:
        - Which app pays drivers more?
        - Are Uber or Lyft drivers more likely to get a tip?
- Focus on Supply/Demand
    - When are prices surging and why?
	-any particular regions?
    - Where in NYC are Ubers/Lyfts being called most frequently?
    - Are there any areas that drivers avoid/cancel more frequently?
    - How long (distance and time) are most trips?
- Focus on Driver Compensation
    - How many rides does the average driver do in a day?
    - How much are they making?
    - Do drivers that drive more often get more tips?
- Ride Identification
    - Which license plates are the most frequent drivers?
    - What time in the day do high frequency cars drive?
    - When do low frequency cars drive in the day?
