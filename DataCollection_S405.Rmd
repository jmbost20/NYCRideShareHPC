# Code to Read In
```{r}
install.packages("arrow")

library(arrow)

```


```{r}
parquet_file <- "fhvhv_tripdata_2020-05.parquet"

df <- read_parquet(parquet_file)

csv_file <- "fhvhv.csv"

write.csv(df, file = csv_file, row.names = FALSE)

# Variables


# Statistical Methods

* Data Analysis- Which company performs best
* Regression



# Computational Steps 

* Data Collection- pull Data from Kaggle (wget)
* Data Cleaning- Convert all Parquet files to CSV (Create some metrics for data conversion to ensure that no data is lost)
* Potentially some Feature Engineering
* Questions- begin to create code to address questions
* Pick one question for proposal
